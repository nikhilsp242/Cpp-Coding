## Size of Data Types

This C++ program demonstrates the use of the **sizeof** operator to determine the sizes of different data types on your system. The program declares variables of various data types and outputs their sizes in bytes.

The code starts by including the necessary header files, iostream and conio.h, for input/output and console functions respectively.

In the main() function:

An integer variable a is declared and initialized with the value 12.
The size of int is displayed using the sizeof operator and printed to the console.
A float variable b is declared.
The size of float is displayed and printed.
A char variable c is declared.
The size of char is displayed and printed.
A bool variable d is declared.
The size of bool is displayed and printed.
A short int variable s is declared.
The size of short int is displayed and printed.
A long int variable l is declared.
The size of long int is displayed and printed.
Finally, a message prompts the user to enter any key to exit the program, and the _getch() function waits for a keypress.
